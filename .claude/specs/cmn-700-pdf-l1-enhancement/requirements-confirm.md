# Requirements Confirmation: CMN-700 PDF L1 Enhancement

## Original Request
"Read structure in CMN-700 PDF, ultrathink and enhance L1 to adapt with the PDF"

## Clarification Process

### Round 1: Initial Analysis
- Analyzed CMN-700 PDF extraction results showing only 11 registers extracted vs expected 700+
- Identified vertical layout issue where array indices and offsets appear on separate lines
- User selected option 2 for all questions (segment-based approach)

### Round 2: Refined Understanding
- User confirmed: Keep existing patterns intact for CMN-437 compatibility
- User confirmed: Success metric is extracting at least 700 registers from CMN-700

## Final Confirmed Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Parse Vertical Array Register Format**: Handle CMN-700's multi-line array register format where array indices `{0-23}` appear on one line and offsets `16'hXXX : 16'hYYY` appear on following lines
2. **Generate Segmented Output**: Split multi-segment arrays into separate CSV entries with modified names (e.g., `non_hash_mem_region_reg0-23` and `non_hash_mem_region_reg24-63`)
3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Keep all existing patterns working for CMN-437 PDFs

### Technical Requirements
1. **Add New Pattern Matcher**: Implement vertical format buffer that collects array indices and matches them with subsequent offset lines
2. **Preserve Existing Code**: Do not modify existing pattern matchers (lines 683-800 in parse_register_tables)
3. **Buffer Management**: Track pending array indices until matching offsets are found

### Success Criteria
1. Extract at least 700 registers from CMN-700 PDF (current: 11)
2. Maintain ~1043 registers extraction from CMN-437 PDF
3. No regression in attribute extraction (4439 for CMN-700, 7704 for CMN-437)

### Implementation Approach
1. Add new buffer variables for array indices before line 642 in parse_register_tables()
2. Add new pattern detection after line 800 (after existing patterns)
3. Implement logic to match array indices with offset lines and register names
4. Generate appropriate segmented entries

## Quality Assessment Score: 95/100

### Score Breakdown
- **Functional Clarity (29/30)**: Clear parsing requirements with specific format examples
- **Technical Specificity (24/25)**: Detailed implementation approach identified
- **Implementation Completeness (24/25)**: Edge cases understood, backward compatibility ensured
- **Business Context (18/20)**: Clear success metrics with quantitative targets

## Ready for Implementation
Requirements are now sufficiently clear to proceed with implementation.
